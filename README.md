# MusicPlayer

Music Player is a website of the front end of the music players. I created this website when I started my journey in web development.
The website contain a page, which shows the name of the songs and cover pages. On the left side of the page there is the favorite/queue column in which all the music your marked favorite will be store for ease of access.

This website has been created using HTML, CSS and JS. 
I am again going to start working on it. 
Am always ready for pull requests.
